# Shelf
Shelf _(Super Handy Electronic Library Function)_ was designed to manage the inventory of a school library in Uganda. It is designed to be used in an offline environment hence the Codeigniter framework and assets such as bootstrap are included in the repository. Composer packages are used for development purposes only, the `vendor` folder is not required to be present for Shelf to work correctly.
